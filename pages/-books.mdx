# Books

<br/>
The most important habit I formed in my early years was reading. I can view the world and comprehend it from various angles thanks to books. The books I read really altered me.



Reading books in Art, Biography, Business, Classics, Fantasy, History, Memoir, Non-fiction, Philosophy, Poetry, Psychology, Science, Science fiction, Self-help, and Travel genres shaped my perspective, broadening understanding, transforming me profoundly. 

These are the books I love the most. These books profoundly alter me.

For more insights into my reading journey, including my preferences, genres, likes, and dislikes, you can follow me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128272854-akshat-talapa).
